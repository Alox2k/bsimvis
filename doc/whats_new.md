BSimVis is a tool to analyze similarities across a collection of binaries, based on [Ghidra](https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency/ghidra) analyzers and the BSim (Behavioral Similarity) plugin. It provides an API and Web interface to upload large quantities of decompiled binaries and BSim feature vectors to a Kvrocks database for similarity analysis, function diffing, and binary family clustering.

# 0.6.0

This release focuses on scan-time triage, function-similarity precision, and maintenance tooling for running collections at scale.

## Scan / fast mode
* **Compare without ingest** : Scan API analyses a file against existing collections without writing indexes, so an analyst can compare a sample with the whole BsimVis instance before deciding to commit it in a collection. Multi-file upload support, container unpacking (archives,
  UPX packed files) and queue with high priority worker.

## Function similarity
* **Weighted cosine & binary cosine** : two new similarity algorithms alongside the existing BSim score, configurable per collection and pool. 
* **Discovery of low similarity functions** : function similarity search only stores high similarity scores. However, during the matching of functions between two binaries, a discovery pass now allows matches below `similarity.min_score` . This can also now be used at runtime with different parameters and algorithms, using **Runtime Greedy Matcher**.

## Clustering
* **Code/library axis split for clustering** : Identified shared library don't score and cluster with original malware code anymore. This allows analyst to focus on unidentified code. Standard library and boilerplate code were also a source of low similarity scores between different architectures. This improved similarity scores and clustering of files with different architecture dependent boilerplate code, focusing on the actual malware code for scoring.

* **Cluster view** : Explore the file cluster dendrogram and get detailed metadata distribution of members (family classification, format, architecture. etc.)

* **SNN clustering** : Based on Incremental Union Find, prevents over-merging of clusters. 

## Tags & metadata
* **New tag namespaces and automatic metadata inference** : Infers metadata from neighbor files

* **Boilerplate tagging** : automatic recognition of common compiler/runtime boilerplate
  function names (mingw, uclibc/libc internals, pformat-style helpers) for fast triage.

## Maintenance tools
* **Collection / pool maintenance API** : delete file entries, and rebuild any step of
  the similarity pipeline for each file or batch, with different parameters and algorithms.
* **`bsimvis transfer`** : copy a collection between instances over the CLI.

## Security
* **XSS fixes** : fixed some sample-derived values reaching `innerHTML` unescaped
  (fixed by new contributor [elhoim](https://github.com/elhoim)), and added a script
  to check for this class of bug going forward.
* Dependency bumps and offline support via vendored libraries.



**Next steps:** benchmarking BSimVis settings and algorithms for the storage/speed/precision
tradeoff across different datasets, to land on good default settings.
